# LMFIT-parametric-scan
Implementation of LMFIT routines for parametric fitting to match observed data, followed by Monte Carlo techniques to explore the parameter space of a particle physics model derived from string theory.

This code was implemented for the publication https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.08520.
